# The following rule is needed for php-fcgi, as apache does an extra rewrite.
#
# In absence of this rule, we would end up with REDIRECT_APIVER in the non-
# php-fcgi case, but with php-fcgi, we get REDIRECT_REDIRECT_APIVER due to
# the extra rewrite.  By rewriting to APIVER (and PREFIX) here, the extra
# rewrite of php-fcgi will result in REDIRECT_APIVER as expected.  In the
# non php-fcgi case, this rule will result in an unused APIVER/PREFIX.
