## Privacy Policy for Zookeeper Online

This Privacy Policy documents the types of information that are
collected and processed by Zookeeper Online.

### What is Zookeeper Online?

Zookeeper Online is free and open source software (FOSS) that assists
in the management of various radio station functions such as music
library, playlists, and charting.  The source code is available at
<https://zookeeper.ibinx.com/>.

### Scope of this Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy covers only the open source components of
Zookeeper Online as released via <https://zookeeper.ibinx.com/>.  Any
radio station or other third-party who makes use of this software is
free to enhance the software.  This may include changes which impact
privacy.  **_In addition to this Privacy Policy, please see also the
privacy policy of the radio station or other party who is hosting the
website you are accessing now._**

### Use of _Cloudflare Turnstile_

Zookeeper Online makes use of Cloudflare Turnstile, a security service
provided by Cloudflare, Inc., to protect this website against malicious
activity and automated bot traffic.  Turnstile helps distinguish human
users from bots in a privacy-preserving way.

#### Data Processing

When Turnstile is triggered, minimal browser and client data (such as
IP address, TLS handshake fingerprint, user-agent and other browser
signals) will be sent to Cloudflare **only for the purpose of
verifying that the request comes from a real browser**.  We do **not**
use Turnstile or its data to profile, track, or identify individual
visitors for marketing or tracking purposes, only to protect the
site’s integrity and prevent abuse.

The website you are visiting is the data controller for data it
collects, and Cloudflare acts as its data processor to provide
security services.  Cloudflare may also act as an independent
controller for certain limited processing necessary to maintain and
improve its global security network, comply with legal obligations,
and prevent abuse.  Data processed by Cloudflare may be transferred to
and stored in Cloudflare's global infrastructure, including servers
outside the European Union.  Such transfers are safeguarded by
appropriate legal mechanisms, including Standard Contractual Clauses
(SCCs).  For more information, please see [Cloudflare's Turnstile Privacy
Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/turnstile-privacy-policy/).

#### Session Cookies

After a successful Turnstile challenge (or other security check), we
store a short-lived session cookie (not persistent) to remember that
your browser has been validated.  This allows you to continue browsing
the site without repeating the Turnstile check on every page or
action.  This cookie expires automatically when the session ends.

This cookie does **not** contain personal information (no name, e-mail,
or account data), and is used only for security validation to confirm
that the browser remains the same.

#### Legal Basis under GDPR

As these cookies are strictly necessary for the security and integrity
of our website, they do not require explicit consent under the GDPR.
Their use is based on our legitimate interest in maintaining a secure
and reliable service.

#### No Advertising or Tracking

Neither this website, nor Zookeeper Online, nor Cloudflare Turnstile
use the data collected for advertising, profiling, or retargeting
purposes.

#### Data Transfers

Data processed by Cloudflare may be transferred to and stored in
Cloudflare's global infrastructure, including servers located outside
the European Union.  Cloudflare relies on mechanisms such as Standard
Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission to
safeguard transfers outside the EU.  See [Cloudflare and GDPR
compliance](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/trust-hub/gdpr/) for more
information.

### What data do we collect and how do we collect it?

For visitors who access Zookeeper Online without logging in, this
website may rely on Turnstile and a session cookie to verify that the
visitor is a real browser, but **we do not collect or store any
personal data beyond the transient technical signals described above
that are strictly necessary for security**.

If you are an authorized user, Zookeeper Online will collect your name
and e-mail address.  We collect and process this information when you
login to our website for the first time.

### How will we use your data?

We collect your data so that we can authenticate your access to our
service and manage your account.  We do not share your data with any
third-parties.

### Cookies, web beacons, and local storage

For visitors who access Zookeeper Online without logging in, we may
use a transient session cookie as outlined above to remember that
your browser has been validated.  **The cookie does not contain any
personally identifiable information.**  The cookie expires automatically
when the session ends.

For visitors who have a user account with us and who login to access
additional content on the website, Zookeeper Online uses transient
session cookies.  These cookies are used to maintain session
information whilst a user is logged in.  The cookies are deleted
automatically when the user logs out or closes the browser.

Zookeeper Online does not use third-party cookies nor web beacons.

Zookeeper Online may use local storage to remember settings to improve
your visit.  We do not store any information in local storage that is
personally identifiable, nor do we use local storage for tracking or
analytics.  You may permanently delete all data in local storage at
any time by using browser functions for this purpose.

### Log files

Zookeeper Online follows a standard practice of using web server log
files. These files log visitors when they access the website. The
information collected by log files includes internet protocol (IP)
address, browser type, date and time of access, and possibly the
referring web page.  This log information is not linked to any
information that is personally identifiable. The purpose of this
information is for administering the site and resolving any technical
issues that may arise.
