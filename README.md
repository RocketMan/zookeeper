and may be deprecated for use with Zookeeper Online in the future.


### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository;
2. Create a database and populate it using the scripts in the 'db'
directory;
3. Copy config/config.example.php to config/config.php, and edit it
to point to your newly created database.
